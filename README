This was my first ever web project, and I'll say, 2 years later, it went very well. 
While it is VERY primiative, it's still cool. It'd be wrong to update/upgrade it, so I won't. It can stay as it is, and it will never change. PRs will not be accepted. 
If you want to see my modern site, look at https://meowcat.site. 

This relic will be hosted at https://sciencesite.meowcat.site
